Simple GUI With simple Java and Xml Programme
The Geometric Perimeter Calculator App is a handy tool for calculating the perimeters of various shapes. 
In this Android application, we've designed a user-friendly interface that focuses on computing the 
perimeters of seven fundamental geometric shapes: square, parallelogram, rectangle, rhombus, 
trapezoid, triangle, and circle.
The application offers dedicated sections for each shape. Users can input the required parameters for a 
specific shape, such as side lengths or radius, and the app will calculate and display the perimeter of that 
shape. We've ensured that the user interface provides clear and intuitive input fields along with 
descriptive labels for each shape to make the calculation process straightforward.
The application's user interface is structured using XML layout files, with a specific focus on the 
mainActivity.xml file. Within this layout, we have organized the user interface components using a 
combination of 8 vertical linear layouts and 5 horizontal linear layouts. This layout design allows for a 
visually pleasing and organized presentation of the input fields, calculation buttons, and results.
To seamlessly navigate between different functionalities, we have employed the use of Android Intents. 
The "intent" keyword is a critical component of Android app development, enabling us to connect and 
transition between various activities. This allows users to move smoothly from one shape's perimeter 
calculation to another, making the application intuitive and user-friendly![LayoutMain](https://github.com/HDDPKaushalya/Simple_Parametercal/assets/147124667/7e7b1cea-d9fa-43a0-888a-a596e6e367d6)![MainActivity]
